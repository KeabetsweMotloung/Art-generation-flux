#Flux-AI-generation projecct
This repository contains the implementation of a text to image model using Flux.1-schnell model. The goal of this project is to generate AI images based on text based prompts and desciptions.

#Project Overview
The Flux.1 schnell Generating text to image models is a crucial task in the healthcare and insurance industries. Accurate predictions can help in planning, budgeting, and providing better financial advice to patients. This project leverages the balck forest labs dataset/model to build a AI model that is able to to generate images based on user prompts the prompts will then be run by different model files and pipelines for inference training. 

#Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the forked repo from the official Black forest labs/Flux git clone -b totoro3 https://github.com/camenduru/ComfyUI /content/TotoroUI. 

#Clone the repository:
bash Copy code git clone(https://github.com/KeabetsweMotloung/Art-generation-flux.git) cd totoro #Install the required packages: torchsde einops diffusers accelerate xformers==0.0.28.post2


initialise nodes/tools for the machine learning pipeline.
Download command line utitly that downloads and splits the files into parts, it will then be initialised into nodes/tools for the machine learning pipeline.

Load the models into memory to ensure that they are used for predictions(inference) and not training.
Evaluate model performance and load the model files downloaded by aria:
